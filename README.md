This project is an AI-driven résumé analysis platform that automatically extracts content from PDF résumés, compares it with job descriptions, and generates actionable insights using Gemini AI.
It is built with FastAPI for high-performance backend services and includes Prometheus and Grafana to provide real-time monitoring, request analytics, and application performance dashboards.
The entire system runs in lightweight, isolated services using Docker, making it easy to deploy, scale, and monitor.
